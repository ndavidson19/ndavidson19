<!-- Professional Bio -->
I currently work as a **Forward Deployed Software Engineer at Palantir Technologies** developing mission-critical technologies. I graduated from **UCLA** with a degree in [Data Theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvW-YjKaaaE), a specialized program combining higher-level Mathematics and Statistics.

I write software professionally in **TypeScript, Rust, Python, Golang and Java**. Previously, I spent two years as a Software Engineer at Cisco, building distributed web services with Golang and React, while leading research into the deployment of Small Language Models (SLMs) on edge hardware.
